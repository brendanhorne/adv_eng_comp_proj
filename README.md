# Meetings
## 21/8/2019
### Attending
Joel, Kelvin, Phillip, Job, Ben, Brendan
### Not Attend
Ryan, Suret, Nader, Shamal
### Agenda
Discuss project brief and allocate tasks.
### Minutes
Joel and Phillip will search for the earthquake data and research the 
inputs required for software like SAP2000, MicroStran and Spacegass.

Ben and Job will model the structure in SAP2000 and Spacegass respectively,
as well as be responsible for incrementally complex verification models as
we progress in developing our code. By having the modelling in 2 software 
packages and by two people, they can verify each others model. This is 
important because we need to know that that models that we are basing our 
Matlab program on are correct.

Kelvin will study the requirements for the group project and will be the 
first point of contact for interpreting scope. He is also be responsible 
for communicating milestones (due dates) and monitoring progress of 
development.

Brendan will develop a skeleton of the code structure and divide work 
amoung other members.
