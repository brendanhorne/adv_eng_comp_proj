### Attending
Joel, Kelvin, Phillip, Job, Ben, Brendan
### Not Attend
Ryan, Suret, Nader, Shamal
### Agenda
Discuss project brief and allocate tasks.
### Minutes
Joel and Phillip will search for the earthquake data and research the inputs required for software

Ben and Job will model the structure in SAP2000 and Spacegass respectively, as well as be responsible for incrementally complex verification models as we progress in developing our code. By having the modelling in 2 software packages and by two people, they can verify each others model. This is important because we need to know that that models that we are basing our Matlab program on are correct.

Kelvin will study the requirements for the group project and will be the first point of contact for interpreting scope. He is also be responsible for communicating milestones (due dates) and monitoring progress of development.

Brendan will develop a skeleton of the code structure and divide work amoung other members.
